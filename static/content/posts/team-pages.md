The latest update: we now have basic support for [Team Pages][2]. The goal
is to get a page for **EVERY** club that's had an IKWF state qualifier.
For now, I've only done it for a select few clubs where I can easily track
down the small changes in club name over the years. At some point I'll be
posting a Google Sheet that the community can crowd source fixes for
duplicate club names.

Since the [Initial Launch][1], there has been a great outpouring of support
from the Illinois wrestling community! I've found **alternate** sources
of historical information (`iwfusaw.org`) and started to get photographs
of bracket boards and scans of old IKWF state programs from people. Special
shout out to:

- Kevin Randolph for scanning 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993 IKWF programs and for
  filling out all of those brackets back when he was competing!
- Todd Combes for his three bracket boards 1990, 1991, and 1993 (can't believe
  you let Matthew Goldstein keep you from a title in 1992!)
- Collin McKillip for his two bracket boards from 1998 and 1999 (1998 is
  currently the **only** year I don't have champions for)
- Clayton Norberg for his bracked board from 1999
- Don Stuckly for the 1975 bracket sheet and for his great ideas

With these new sources of information, I've started to include the
bracket boards or bracket sheets on the bracket page to give a bit more life.
I've also got champs dating back all the way to the first IKWF state
tournament in 1971.
