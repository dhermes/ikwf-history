After weeks of hard work, we have finished processing all (available)
bracket data from 1999 to 2025. These brackets are all available today:

- [1999](/brackets/1999/index.html)
- [2000](/brackets/2000/index.html)
- [2001](/brackets/2001/index.html)
- [2002](/brackets/2002/index.html)
- [2003](/brackets/2003/index.html)
- [2004](/brackets/2004/index.html)
- [2005](/brackets/2005/index.html)
- [2006](/brackets/2006/index.html)
- [2007](/brackets/2007/index.html)
- [2008](/brackets/2008/index.html)
- [2009](/brackets/2009/index.html)
- [2010](/brackets/2010/index.html)
- [2011](/brackets/2011/index.html)
- [2012](/brackets/2012/index.html)
- [2013](/brackets/2013/index.html)

- [2015](/brackets/2015/index.html)
- [2016](/brackets/2016/index.html)
- [2017](/brackets/2017/index.html)
- [2018](/brackets/2018/index.html)
- [2019](/brackets/2019/index.html)
- [2020](/brackets/2020/index.html)
- [2022](/brackets/2022/index.html)
- [2023](/brackets/2023/index.html)
- [2024](/brackets/2024/index.html)
- [2025](/brackets/2025/index.html)

This is just the tip of the iceberg! Now that we've got a **LARGE** sampling
of bracket data, we'll be using it to start tracking historical records for
clubs and individuals. The very next things we'll be doing are:

- Tracking wrestlers over time (e.g. `BERNARD FUTRELL II` and `BJ FUTRELL II`
  are not actually two different wrestlers)
- Tracking clubs over time (e.g. `CARY JR TROJAN MATMEN` and
  `Cary-Grove Matmen` are not actually two different clubs)
- Adding landing pages with historical records for clubs (state qualifiers,
  state placers, state champs)
- Tracking down brackets from previous years
- Displaying team scores
- Adding landing pages for wrestlers (results across different tournaments,
  number of pins, number of tech falls, high school placements, etc.)
