After a super helpful summer of collecting old programs, we now have virtually
**ALL** history of the IKWF state tournament. Huge thanks to the contributors
that gave me physical copies of old programs, scanned old programs, or sent in
pictures of bracket boards:

- Terry Weber
- Mike Urwin
- Corey Atwell
- Clayton Norberg
- Todd Combes
- Collin McKillip
- Kevin Randolph

Go to the [brackets](/brackets/index.html) page to see **ALL** of the years 1971
to 2025! From here I'd love more help to find competitors (or matches) from the
missing years.

Through a variety of sources, we have match results from almost all 55 years,
competitor lists from an even larger number, places from all but 6 years, and
champs from every year! The remaining archival work to be done is to track down
the missing data or complete partial data (e.g. match results).
