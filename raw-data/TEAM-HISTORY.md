the arena, alone, to face his opponent in front of his parents and peers, is
already a winner.

The club produced its first state qualifier in 1978, and to date has sent 105
wrestlers to the State Tournament, with 27 place winners and four state
champions. As a team, Rich Wrestling has won eight Regional championships, four
Sectional championships, and a 7th and 3rd place finish at the State Finals.

Youth wrestling came to the Oak Park / River forest area in 1978 when Joe
Deprisio formed the Jr. Huskie Wrestling Club. Fred Arkin joined Joe as an
assistant the following year and would go on to become Head Coach and to lead
youth wrestling in the Oak Park area for over ten years.

Around 1983 when Oak Park's Fenwick High School formed its first wrestling team,
the Jr. Huskies changed their name to the Warhawk Wrestling Club and merging the
colors of OPRF and Fenwick adopted the Black and Orange by which they are known
today.

Eddie Baker became an assistant to Fred Arkin in 1985 and was joined shortly
thereafter by Frank Mohorn who now leads the Maywood Pirate Wrestling Club. At
the end of the '87 - '88 season Fred Arkin moved from the Oak Park area to
Hoffman Estates where he formed and still leads the Mead Jr. Cougars IKWF Club
and also serves as Chairman of the Illinois Wrestling Federation.

Throughout the years the Warhawks have introduced wrestling to athletes from a
wide area of surrounding communities. This paid off for wrestling and the IKWF
when in 1992 Frank Mohorn was able to form the Maywood Pirates using a core of
experienced Warhawk wrestlers to better serve the youth from the
Maywood-Bellwood area. Although this splitting process initially diminished the
size and strength of the Warhawks, it is also spreads wrestling participation to
an ever greater number of youths. Today the Pirates and Warhawks maintain a very
close relationship and assist each other on many aspects of their club
operations.

The Warhawks are proud of their competitive record, which includes a decade of
top 10 finishes in the State Tournament, and of their alumni that includes IKWF
and IHSA state champions Alan Cartwright, Joe Cartwright, Herb House, Mike
Powell, Pete Schulte, and Reggie Wright.

The Warhawks have also been involved in the support and promotion of Freestyle
and Greco-Roman competition through the IWF for many years and have been an
annual host of the Team Illinois Qualifier competition for many years.
