# IKWF History

Collection of state tournament brackets for the [IKWF][1] (Illinois Kids
Wrestling Federation). The goal is to collect all historical IKWF brackets
and centralize them in one place. Using the [wayback machine][2], scans from
past participants, and other methods, we'll get the "raw" / unprocessed
brackets and then normalize them and present them here.
